# Worst SEO Ever

This project contains an intentionally terrible landing page used as a proof of concept for SEO audit tools and automation. The `index.html` file demonstrates bad practices on purpose, including:

- Missing `<title>` and meta tags
- No semantic structure or headings
- Table-based layout instead of CSS
- Repeated keyword stuffing and duplicate paragraphs
- Invisible text the same color as the background
- Images with no `alt` attributes
- Blocking JavaScript that causes an infinite loop
- Non-responsive design and meaningless query strings

The goal is to fail every SEO test so that automated fixes can be experimented with.
